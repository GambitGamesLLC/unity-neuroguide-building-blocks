# unity-neuroguide-building-blocks
Unity3D project that utilizes the NeuroGuide hardware to show a visualizer experience.  

In this experience, a series of block pieces form into a cube.  

As the user is in a 'success' state while using the NeuroGuide hardware, the cube forms.  
When the user is not in a success state, the cube splits apart.
